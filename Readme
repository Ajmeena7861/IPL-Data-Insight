# IPL Data Analysis (2008-2024)

## üìå Project Overview
This project analyzes **Indian Premier League (IPL) matches from 2008 to 2024** using **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**. The dataset includes match details, player performances, and team statistics. The goal is to extract insights such as:
- **Top-performing teams and players** over the years
- **Win percentage of teams**
- **Player of the Tournament** based on Player of the Match awards
- **Scoring trends (first innings vs second innings)**
- **Head-to-head comparisons between teams**

## üìÇ Dataset Details
**File Name:** `IPL_Dataset(2008-2024).csv`

### **Columns in the Dataset:**
- **match_id** - Unique identifier for each match
- **date** - Date of the match
- **teams** - Teams that played the match
- **venue** - Stadium where the match was played
- **toss_winner** - Team that won the toss
- **toss_decision** - Decision after winning the toss (batting/bowling)
- **first_innings_score** - Runs scored in the first innings
- **second_innings_score** - Runs scored in the second innings
- **winner** - Team that won the match
- **player_of_match** - Player who won the Man of the Match award
- **year** - Year of the match

## üìä Key Analysis & Insights
